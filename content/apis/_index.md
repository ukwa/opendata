APIs and Data Services
--------------------------------

Traditionally, the online presence of most archives and museums have focussed on delivering access to individual items, directly to users, one by one. This is changing. As more items are either born digital or have excellent digital facsimiles, [GLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAM_(industry_sector)) are beginning to offer data access and services in addition to simple direct use. This allows the communities we serve to build great things. 

One of the most successful examples is that of the National Library of Australia's [Trove](http://trove.nla.gov.au/) database, which provides [a rich API](http://trove.nla.gov.au/general/api), that allows [independent developers](http://wraggelabs.com/emporium/2012/04/the-new-api-powered-future/) to create all sorts of [generous interfaces](http://www.dancohen.org/2012/12/05/generous-interfaces-for-scholarly-sites/). Similarly, the British Library provides various [free data services](http://www.bl.uk/bibliographic/datafree.html) and the National Archives of the UK has started offering [direct API access](http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/api.htm) to its discovery systems.

Web archives have also tended to focus on the playback of individual web pages via Wayback machine instances, and this is the way most users are used to interacting with our archives.
However, for many years now, that same playback infrastructure has been used to develop other data and interfaces to the content. These APIs allow structured metadata about archival holdings to be retrieved programmatically, and in [blog] (https://blogs.bl.uk/webarchive/) posts we hope to explore how the Wayback queries and Memento protocols can be used to exploit web archives.

Alongside these online services, we've also been exploring the possibilities around making metadata datasets available for research and analysis which we describe in these pages. 


The Wayback API
------------------------

The Wayback query API allows users to retrieve information about resources in Wayback instances. [Examples and Formats] (http://wwwoh-access.archive.org/wwwoh/waybackapi.htm)

Use cases include wikipedia link rot prevention like that undertaken by the [Internet Archive Bot] (https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/InternetArchiveBot).

The Memento API
-------------------------
Memento provides a mechanism to standardise methods of web archive discovery - a basic overview is [here] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_Project#Usage).
